# ModMod Programming enviorment

ModMod (Modular Modeling) is an environment that allows we to program and execute in a modular way a set of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that interact with each other, without importing that each system advances to a different time scale.


To install the module as any other python module:

``
sudo python3 setup.py install
``

(is a pure Python module and therefore is platform independent), or directly from this repository:

``
pip install git+https://github.com/jdmolinam/ModMod_Programming_environment.git
``
